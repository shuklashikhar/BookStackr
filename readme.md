## What is BookStackr?

BookStackr is a comprehensive book tracking application allowing the users to track their read books by year, category and format.

Book data can be viewed both in table and chart format.

The app can be used with mock data without user authentication. Alternatively, users can sign in with their Google accounts and save their book data to a secure Firestore database for later use.
